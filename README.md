Official Title:	A Phase III Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Following Chemoradiation as Primary Treatment for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Compared to Chemoradiation Alone: The OUTBACK Trial

Arms	Assigned Interventions
Experimental: Arm I (cisplatin, radiation therapy, brachytherapy)
Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo external-beam radiation therapy once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 5 weeks. Patients then undergo high-dose rate, pulsed-dose rate, or low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy.

Experimental: Arm II (cisplatin, radiation therapy, brachytherapy, chemo)
Patients receive cisplatin and undergo external-beam radiation and brachytherapy as in arm I. Beginning 4 weeks later, patients also receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

We don’t technically have a “clinical trials app.”  For the computers, we have installed a “protocol library” on the network drive.  For every study this includes the current protocol and consent, which are ready to print.  You probably have a similar system at UT Southwest.   This month we experimented with a version of the current protocol lists that can be downloaded to iphone.  I have not tried this yet.  Jocelyn will provide instructions for how we have done this.




Hello Annette,

We produce a protocol Booklet listing all currently enrolling protocols available, sorted by disease site and containing an overview of eligibility criteria per study. This booklet is made available electronically in our protocol library that Ingrid mentioned below. We also have .pdf and ePub formats available so our providers can download onto their mobile devices and browse like an ebook. In this manner, we do not have to create a specific app. Providers can jump from disease site to disease site like they would ebook chapters.

I utilize this website to aid me in my conversion from .pdf to ePub. http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-epub

When I broadcast the new version of the booklet, I include these instructions:

Please see the instructions below on how to access this document on your smartphone or tablet device.  

1.       You can open PDF documents, such as a PDF attached to an email, with your eReader app on your phone:
1.       Open the email with the PDF attachment, and tap the attachment.
2.       Tap the Share icon in the upper-right corner.
3.       Tap "Open in iBooks/kindle/google play books" to open the attachment. Ereader app will open, and you can view your PDF.

You can also select preview in Polaris if you have that app on your phone to save it for android phones.

4.       The same apps can also view ePub with is the other format attached. Please select the most convenient one for your viewing pleasure.


Lesley:   It would be awesome if there was some way it could be marketed by Gyn Onc for a small fee if we could pull directly from clinicaltrials.gov and any division/researcher/MD could plug in their specific studies.
